# Pull Request Pipeline

This is to check and merge the given pull request and perform the CICD on the merged branch.
Below checks are done as before merging the PR
- PR is approved with the required number of approvers
- PR passes required PR checks (Future)

If the given PR is already merged, skip the merging and proceed with CICD by cloning the merged branch.
If the given PR is not merged and passes all conditions, merge the PR and proceed with CICD by cloning the merged branch.

Also, it adds the PR number to the deployment package name. Format: ${PACKAGE_NAME}_pr_${PR_NUMBER}

# Future Thoughts

Merger utility can be kept as a Shared Jenkins pipeline library so that all the repos can leverage this without code duplication. 

Refer [this](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/) link for more details on the Jenkins Shared Pipeline library
